# To-Do

### rexql Addon Development Tasks

1. update `rexql` readme with new features and usage instructions
2. ~~implement yform tables resolver, like an all-round resolver for `rex_yform_table` to fetch data from YForm tables~~~
   - [x] implement basic resolver for YForm tables, with basic `be_manager_relation` support (data JSON encoded)
   - [ ] add support for `be_manager_relation` fields, by adding related tables and data/types to the Schema and resolving them
3. (prio 2) implement missing translations and check existing translations for consistency
